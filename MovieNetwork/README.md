A. Source Code

The source code (ReadData.py and WriteData.py) are used for generating the GraphML format files. I did the programming in Python2.7+Eclipse environment. But one can compile the two Python files in any Python platform.

Here are instructions for compiling and running the code:
	(1) Create a folder named 'MovieLens' in your local disk.
	(2) Create 3 folders named 'Raw Data', 'src', 'GraphML' in 'MovieLens' folder.
	(3) Go to http://www.grouplens.org/node/73, download 'MovieLens 1M Data Set' zip file.
	(4) Extract the downloaded zip file and then you will get three data files: movies.dat, ratings.dat, users.dat. Put these three data files into 'Raw Data' folder.
	(5) Download the source code files (ReadData.py and WriteData.py) from my website and put them into 'src' folder.
	(6) Compile and run these two Python files with ReadData.py being a module:
		python ReadData.py
		python WriteData.py
		(In Windows Systems, you can double-click WriteData.py to execute it). Then enter an integer for time-window size.
	(7) You will get your generated GraphML files in 'MovieLens/GraphML' folder.

B. Sample GraphML file

This sample file was generated by using a 1-day time span. The nodes represent users and movies, while the edges representing ratings between users and movies.
